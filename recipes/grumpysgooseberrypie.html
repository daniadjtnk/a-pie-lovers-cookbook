    <h3><b>INGREDIENT</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Pie Crust:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup of unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>6-8 tablespoons of ice-cold water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Filling:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups of fresh gooseberries, washed and stems removed</li>
                <li>1 cup of sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>¼ cup of cornstarch or tapioca flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of lemon zest</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of butter, for dotting</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>INGREDIENT</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Prepare the Crust:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, mixing until the dough forms. Divide it into two portions, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Make the Filling:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a bowl, mix the gooseberries, sugar, cornstarch (or tapioca flour), and lemon zest until the berries are evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Roll out one portion of the chilled dough and line a pie dish. Pour the prepared gooseberry mixture into the crust. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Top the Pie:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Roll out the second portion of the dough and create a lattice or full crust to cover the pie. Seal the edges and trim any excess dough. Optionally, brush the top crust with milk or beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bake the Pie:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake for 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. If the edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Serve:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the Grumpy's Gooseberry Pie to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy a slice of this tangy-sweet delight, perhaps with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Grumpy's Gooseberry Pie encapsulates the essence of old-fashioned baking, bringing together the tartness of fresh gooseberries and the comforting warmth of a buttery crust. Each bite offers a nostalgic journey into the realm of homemade goodness.</p>
